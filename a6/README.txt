What's something cool, interesting, frustrating, or tangentially relevant that this assignment made you think about?
If you could have these assignments without an interp function. Just the type
checking code. It'd be weird to think about just having a type checking engine.

What was the best part of this assignment?
Recursive types.

What was the worst part of this assignment?
Figuring out how to synthesise a sum type when there are no rules to do so.
