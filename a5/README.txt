What's something cool, interesting, frustrating, or tangentially relevant that this assignment made you think about?

It's kind of interesting thinking about the best way to test that certain code
get "infinitely" loops. It's impossible to actually prove due to the halting
problem, but an infinite loop breaks most unit test environments.

What was the best part of this assignment?

Being able to see how the execution flows with loops and begin statements.

What was the worst part of this assignment?

Figuring out how to implement the logic for problem 3.
